        <h2>&mdash; Hello, &mdash;<br> &#91; I'm Peter &#93;</h2>  
        <p class="bio">I am a sophomore studying Computer Science Engineering. Earlier this school year, I found myself fending for my life after moving into an apartment with no meal plan for the first time. After too many bowls of instant ramen and frozen chicken nuggets, I took a stand for myself and decided to learn how to cook. Since then, I have made quite a few dishes that I feel are perfect for a college student; Quick, Delicious, and Easy. Check out some of these recipes and try them yourself!</p>
